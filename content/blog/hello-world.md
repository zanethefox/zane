Hi there and welcome to my first blog post on the brand-new website!~ I'm really excited about it, and I hope you have a nice time here, discover all the little details and animations I put here and there, and enjoy browsing!

Welcome to my smol cosy corner here on the internet. On my blog I'll be sharing all sorts of smaller updates, behind the scenes of my work as a website developer, and general coffee vibes.

## Welcome :3

I'm Zane, a soft floofy fox, that's part of the website development team for [NordicFuzzCon](https://nordicfuzzcon.org), enjoys photography, coffee, mechanical keyboards and computers. I also love to indulge in some new hobbies, such as DJing or music.

You can probably mostly find me hanging out listening to some drum and bass, indie anthems or sometimes some alternative.

When I'm not coding, I'll be playing some Minecraft, Fortnite or some cosier games like Animal Crossing.

## What to expect

Pretty much, I just wanted a creative outlet where I can share projects, or anything else, that might not fit on my other social platforms.

You can also expect to see some cool updates on the projects I am working on!

### Have fun!

Hope to see you sticking around, and if you want, feel free to connect with me on my [socials](/socials)!
